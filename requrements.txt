# ADSBee Monitor Requirements
#
# Good news! We ONLY use Python standard library modules.
# No external packages are required!
#
# Python Version: 3.6+ required (tested with 3.10)
#
# The monitors use these built-in modules:
# - socket       (WebSocket implementation)
# - base64       (WebSocket handshake)
# - struct       (Binary data handling)
# - sys, os      (System operations)
# - time         (Timing functions)
# - datetime     (Timestamps)
# - argparse     (Command-line arguments)
# - select       (I/O multiplexing)
# - threading    (Concurrent operations)
# - re           (Regular expressions)
# - collections  (deque for buffers)
# - termios, tty, fcntl  (Terminal control - Unix/Linux only)
#
# No pip install required!

# Optional: If you want colored output in Windows, you could install:
colorama==0.4.6
# But this is NOT required - the monitors work without it.
